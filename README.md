## Build from source

Unless you're planning on working on the source code, you probably down't need to build this from the source.

However, if you do want to build it, this is how:

1. Ensure that you've got a working Go work environment (see [How to Write Go Code][go-how]) with Go 1.4 or above.

2. Clone the repository into your working directory

  ```sh
  git clone git@github.com:matiaskorhonen/gemsearch-alfred.git \
    $GOPATH/src/github.com/matiaskorhonen/gemsearch-alfred

  cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/matiaskorhonen/gemsearch-alfred
  ```

3. Make the Alfred extension with `make workflow`

4. Install the workflow from the `build` directory
